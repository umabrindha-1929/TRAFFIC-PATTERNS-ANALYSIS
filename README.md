# TRAFFIC-PATTERNS-ANALYSIS-NM

Traffic Patterns Analysis


📌 Introduction

This project aims to analyze and predict hourly traffic volume patterns using a simple linear regression model. By simulating traffic data, we demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to forecast traffic trends, which is crucial for urban planning and traffic management.

🎯 Objective

Simulate hourly traffic volume data to mimic real-world traffic patterns.

Apply linear regression to model and predict future traffic volumes.

Visualize both observed and predicted traffic data for analysis.


📊 Data Source

The dataset used in this project is synthetically generated to simulate realistic traffic patterns. For real-world applications, datasets such as the Traffic Prediction Dataset on Kaggle can be utilized, which contains hourly data from 2012 to 2018.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

NumPy for numerical computations

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib for data visualization

scikit-learn for implementing linear regression


📈 Visualization

The project generates a line plot displaying:

Observed traffic volumes for each hour (blue solid line)

Predicted traffic volumes for future hours (red dashed line)

This visualization helps in understanding the traffic flow and the effectiveness of the prediction model.
